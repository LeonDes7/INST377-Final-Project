          <h3>What is AniList?</h3>
          <p>
            AniList is a website that users can use to keep track of anime,
            categorizing them into sections such as
            <i>completed</i>, <i>watching</i>, <i>rewatching</i>,
            <i>dropped</i>, and <i>plan to watch</i>. The website also allows
            users to favorite anime, add their thoughts to them, view other
            people's anime lists, and post on the AniList forum.

          <p>
            Your AniList profile might be set to private. Please make sure your
            profile is set to public to enable the recommendation feature. To
            make your AniList profile visible, on the AniList website, go to
            settings, account, then scroll down to privacy. Select either public
            or semi-public.
