        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to AniList Recommender, an application that allows AniList
          users to generate a list of recommended anime based on their anime
          list. This application also allows users to compare their list with
          other AniList users. The specifics of both sections are as follows:<br /><br />
        </p>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>
          This is where you input an AniList username to view any recommended
          anime that are not in that user's anime list. You can also select
          genres, tags, and statuses to view anime with those filters.
        </p>
        <h3>Compare Lists</h3>
        <p>
          This is where you input two AniList usernames. Click a status checkbox
          to view all anime that is on the second user's lists under that
          status. For example, if you were to click the "Completed" checkbox, it
          would show all of the completed anime on the second user's list. It
          will also display what the statuses are for those anime on user 1's
          list as well.
